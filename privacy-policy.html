  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: December 2, 2025</em></p>

  <p>Welcome to <strong>Face AI Analyzer</strong> (the "App"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    The App does <strong>not collect personally identifiable information</strong>
    (such as your name, email, or phone number). Data you enter in the App
    (such as your FaceScore results, duel outcomes, or local settings) is
    stored <strong>locally</strong> on your device and is not intentionally
    transmitted to our own servers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The App may collect <strong>anonymized technical data</strong> for analytics,
    diagnostics, and purchase validation, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>App version and device model</li>
    <li>Usage data (e.g. which features are used, how often scans/duels are started)</li>
    <li>Purchase events and subscription status (via RevenueCat)</li>
    <li>Crash reports and technical performance data</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Any such data is used only to improve the App’s stability, understand feature usage,
    and support in-app purchases. It is not used to identify you personally.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Face Scans and Photos</h2>
  <p>
    The core functionality of Face AI Analyzer is to analyze your face using AI
    and generate an aesthetic score and related metrics.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your face images and scan results are used only to display scores, history, and duel outcomes inside the App.</li>
    <li>Images and results are stored locally on your device, unless you explicitly export or share them (for example, by saving a duel card to Photos).</li>
    <li>We do not sell your images or scores and do not use them for advertising.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Please remember that if you share screenshots, duel cards, or other media outside
    of the App (e.g., on social media or by messaging), they will then be governed
    by the privacy practices of those services.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Push Notifications</h2>
  <p>
    The App don't send you <strong>push notifications</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>4. Purchases and Payments</h2>
  <p>The App offers premium access via subscriptions and a lifetime purchase under the subscription group <strong>“Premium”</strong>, which unlocks <strong>unlimited scans, duels &amp; result saving</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Weekly Subscription:</strong> US$ 3.99 / week</li>
    <li><strong>Annual Subscription:</strong> US$ 19.99 / year</li>
    <li><strong>Lifetime Access:</strong> US$ 24.99 (one-time)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Premium access unlocks <strong>unlimited FaceScore scans, AI face duels
    and saving your results/duel cards</strong> within the App.
  </p>
  <p>
    All purchases are securely processed by Apple via the App Store. We do not
    collect or store your full payment information (such as your credit card
    number). That information is handled directly by Apple.
  </p>
  <p>
    Purchase status and subscription management are handled via
    <strong>RevenueCat</strong>, a third-party service that uses anonymous
    User IDs and may use device identifiers for fraud prevention and purchase
    validation purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We follow industry-standard practices to help protect data integrity and
    security. Because the App stores data primarily on your device and does not
    collect personal registration data, privacy risks are minimized.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, no mobile application or online service can guarantee 100% security.
    You are responsible for keeping your device secure (for example, by using
    a passcode or biometric lock).
  </p>

  <h2>6. Sharing Your Information</h2>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or trade your personal data with
    third parties.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anonymized purchase-related and usage events may be shared with
    <strong>RevenueCat</strong> strictly to operate, validate, and support
    in-app purchases and subscriptions.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Your Rights and Controls</h2>
  <p>You can manage your data and purchases in several ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can delete the App at any time, which removes locally stored data from your device.</li>
    <li>You can manage, cancel, or restore your purchases via your Apple ID account settings (Subscriptions section).</li>
    <li>You can disable push notifications at any time via your device’s system settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    This App is <strong>not intended for children under 13 years old</strong>
    and does not knowingly collect any personal information from children.
    If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided
    information to us, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    We use <strong>RevenueCat</strong> to manage in-app purchases and subscriptions.
    RevenueCat may collect anonymized data such as purchase history, product interactions,
    and device information solely for:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Enabling and validating in-app purchases and subscriptions</li>
    <li>Basic analytics (e.g. which products are purchased)</li>
    <li>Fraud prevention and abuse detection</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This data is <strong>not used for tracking you across other apps or for
    targeted advertising purposes</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in
    the App or in applicable laws. When we do, we will update the “Last updated”
    date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the App after any changes
    means you accept the updated Policy.
  </p>
