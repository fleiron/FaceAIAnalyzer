  <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
  <p class="small"><em>Last updated: December 4, 2025</em></p>

  <p>These Terms govern your use of the mobile application <strong>Face AI Analyzer</strong> (the “App”). By downloading or using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>

  <h2>1) Overview</h2>
  <p>The App provides AI-based face analysis features (e.g., appearance scoring, optional comparisons, local history). The App is intended for entertainment and self-insight only and <strong>must not</strong> be used as a medical, diagnostic, or professional tool.</p>

  <h2>2) Eligibility</h2>
  <p>You must be at least <strong>13 years old</strong> to use the App.</p>

  <h2>3) User Content & Processing</h2>
  <p>The App processes photos you provide solely to perform local analysis and display results. Processing occurs on your device. If you choose to export/share content, that is governed by the receiving service’s policies.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You confirm you have the right to use any photos you submit.</li>
    <li>Do not upload images of other people without their consent.</li>
    <li>Do not use the App in any unlawful, harmful, or abusive manner.</li>
  </ul>

   <h2>4) No Professional Advice</h2>
  <p>Scores, tips, or comparisons are algorithmic outputs for entertainment and general self-insight only. The wellness and appearance suggestions in the App are based on publicly available information from reputable health institutions (for example Mayo Clinic, American Academy of Dermatology, Sleep Foundation, and similar sources), but they remain general in nature. <strong>No medical, psychological, aesthetic, or other professional advice is provided, and the App must not be used to diagnose, treat, or monitor any condition.</strong></p>


  <h2>5) In-App Purchases</h2>
  <p>The App may offer optional premium access (e.g., subscriptions or lifetime purchase) that unlocks extended features (such as increased scan limits or saving results). Payments are processed by Apple. You can manage or cancel your subscription in your Apple ID settings.</p>
  <p>Purchase status and entitlements are verified through <strong>RevenueCat</strong> using anonymous identifiers. We do not handle your full payment details.</p>

  <h2>6) Refunds</h2>
  <p>Refunds for in-app purchases are handled exclusively by Apple per App Store policies.</p>

  <h2>7) Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>You agree not to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, or modify the App</li>
    <li>Use the App to harass, discriminate, or conduct harmful comparisons</li>
    <li>Upload unlawful, explicit, or violent images</li>
    <li>Attempt to bypass paywalls, rate limits, or subscription checks</li>
    <li>Use the App for <strong>impersonation</strong> or creation of <strong>harmful synthetic media</strong> that violates privacy, publicity, or applicable laws</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8) Privacy</h2>
  <p>Your use of the App is also governed by our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, which explains data practices. By using the App, you agree to the Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h2>9) Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>All content, features, branding, and design elements are owned by the developer or its licensors and are protected by applicable laws. You may not copy, distribute, or create derivative works without written permission.</p>

  <h2>10) Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
  <p>The App is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee continuous operation, error-free performance, or scientific accuracy of algorithmic outputs.</p>

  <h2>11) Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any decisions or actions you take based on App outputs, loss of data upon deletion of the App, or any indirect/incidental/consequential damages.</p>

  <h2>12) Termination</h2>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms. You may stop using the App at any time by deleting it from your device.</p>

  <h2>13) Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms. The “Last updated” date will reflect the latest version. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>
